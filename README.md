# Deep-BCN


Deep-BCN uses a pre-trained vgg16 model from [slim](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/slim). You can downoad the files directly from their website or download the needed files from here. simpler . Unzip the file in the same folder as the repository.

Set the parameters in the notebook.
